# 🌐 HTML Course — Sigma Web Development by CodeWithHarry

## 🎓 About This Repository

This repository contains my learning and practice files from the **HTML section** of the **Sigma Web Development Course** by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.codewithharry.com).
It includes all the concepts, examples, and mini-projects I built while mastering the fundamentals of **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**.

## 💡 What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and structure webpages.
It describes the **content and layout** of a webpage using **tags** and **elements**.

HTML is the foundation of every website — it tells browsers **what to display** and **how to organize content** like text, images, links, and videos.

## 🧩 What Are HTML Tags?

Tags are special keywords enclosed in angle brackets `< >` that tell the browser how to display content.
Every HTML tag usually comes in **a pair**:

* An **opening tag** → `<tagname>`
* A **closing tag** → `</tagname>`

Example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Here, `<p>` tells the browser to start a paragraph, and `</p>` tells it to end the paragraph.
